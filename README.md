# FLOPS MicroBenchmark

This microbenchmark's goal is to achieve as much FLOP per second as possible, in simple precision (SP), trying to stay close to the theoretical peak performance, on x86 architectures.

To achieve this, there are different executables for each specific CPU microarchitecture, which can be summarized in the following table (you will find them in `output` directory):

##### Intel
| Microarchitecture    | Executable name   |
|:--------------------:|:-----------------:|
| Sandy Bridge         | `sandy_bridge`    |
| Ivy Bridge           | `ivy_bridge`      |
| Haswell              | `haswell`         |
| Broadwell            | `broadwell`       |
| Skylake              | `skylake`         |
| Kaby Lake            | `kaby_lake`       |
| Coffe Lake           | `coffe_lake`      |
| Cannon Lake(AVX2)    | `cannon_lake_256` |
| Cannon Lake(AVX512)  | `cannon_lake_512` |
| Ice Lake(AVX2)       | `ice_lake_256`    |
| Ice Lake(AVX512)     | `ice_lake_512`    |
| KNL(Knights Landing) | `knl`             |

##### AMD
| Architecture         | Executable file  |
|:--------------------:|:----------------:|
| Ryzen ZEN            | `zen`            |
| Ryzen ZEN+           | `zen_plus`       |

__NOTE: This test will not work if you run it under a CPU which hasn't neccesary instructions, like AVX or FMA__

## Usage
Compile with `make` and choose the right executable, according to the previous table. If your CPU's microarchitecture is not included in the table, please write an issue and I will consider adding it to the project.

The microbenchmark has several options, which can be checked via `-h`:

```
[noob@drnoob FLOPS]$ ./haswell -h
Usage: ./haswell [-h] [-r n_trials] [-w warmup_trials] [-t n_threads]
    Options:
      -h      Print this help and exit
      -r      Set the number of trials of the benchmark
      -w      Set the number of warmup trials
      -t      Set the number of threads to use
```

All of them are optional, so you can run the microbenchmark without arguments:

```
[noob@drnoob FLOPS]$ ./haswell

```

To achieve the best results, you should run this test with the computer working under minimum load. If you're using Linux, a good way to do this is by issuing `systemctl isolate multi-user.target`.

## Is my CPU behaving as it should?
#### 1. The formula

To know if you are reaching the peak performance of your CPU, run this benchmark and compare the experimental results with the theoretical peak performance of your CPU. This can be calculated as:

```
N_CORES*FREQUENCY*2(FMA)*2(Two FMA Units)*(SIZE_OF_VECTOR/32)
```

The size of vector will be 256 if you are using AVX, or 512 if you are using AVX512. You have to take into account if you have 1 or 2 units, or if you have FMA or not. For example, for a i7-4790K, we have:

```
4*3.997*10^9*2*2*(256/32) = 511.61 GFLOP/S
```

And, as you can see in the previous test, we got 511.38 GFLOP/S, which tell us test is working good and CPU is behaving exactly as we expected. But, why did I chosse 3.997 GHz as the frequency?

#### 2. About the frequency to use in the formula

While running this microbenchmark, your CPU will be executing AVX code, so the frequency of your CPU running this code is neither your base nor your turbo frequency. Please, have a look at [this document](http://www.dolbeau.name/dolbeau/publications/peak.pdf) (on section IV.B) for more information.

The vendor of your processor may have published this frequency but this happens rarely. The most effective way I know to get this frequency is to to actually measure your CPU frequency on real time while running AVX code. You can use the script [freq.sh](https://github.com/Dr-Noob/FLOPS/freq.sh) to achieve this:
1. Run the microbenchmark in background (`output/microbench -r 4 -w 0 > /dev/null &`)
2. Run the script (`./freq.sh`) which will fetch your CPU frequency in real time. In my case, I get:

```
Every 0,2s: grep 'MHz' /proc/cpuinfo

cpu MHz         : 3997.629
cpu MHz         : 3997.629
cpu MHz         : 3997.630
cpu MHz         : 3997.630
cpu MHz         : 3997.630
cpu MHz         : 3997.630
cpu MHz         : 3997.629
cpu MHz         : 3997.630
```

As you can see, i7-4790K's frequency while running AVX code is ~3997.630 MHz, which equals to 3.997 GHz. However, you may see that your frequency fluctuates too much, so that it's impossible to estimate the frequency of your CPU. This may happen due to reasons:
1. The microbenchmark is not working correctly. You may contact me to try to fix the problem.
2. Your CPU is not able to keep a stable frequency. This often happens if it's to hot, so the CPU is forced to low the frequency to not to melt itself.

#### 3. What if I do not get the expected results?
You should contact me to fix the problem!

## How this microbenchmark works
This test will run vectorized instructions(eg AVX, AVX512) with FMA (if available) in a loop(10^9 times, by default) in parallel, so this will try to achieve the best performance in the current CPU.

## Tests done so far
Here follows a table where I'll be updating results using different processors using this benchmark.

| CPU                          | AVX Freq    | PP (Formula)     | PP (Experimental)        | Loss    |
|:----------------------------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:------------------------:|:-------:|
| Intel i7-4790K (Haswell)     | `3.997 GHz` | `511.61 GFLOP/S` | `511.43 +- 0.01 GFLOP/S` | `0.03%` |
| Intel i7-5500U (Broadwell)   | `2.895 GHz` | `185.28 GFLOP/S` | `183.03 +- 0.28 GFLOP/S` | `1.21%` |
| Intel i7-8700  (Coffe Lake)  | `4.300 GHz` | `825.60 GFLOP/S` | `823.83 +- 0.01 GFLOP/S` | `0.21%` |

_NOTE_: On some machines, I'm not root or even the person running the microbenchmark, in which case, the possible overhead (because of not running the microbenchmark in a adequate environment) may deteriorate the results.

Cells marked with an asterisk (\*) indicates that such data has been obtanied via experimentation because I did not found such information on the web (may be oudated). Cells containing ??? means I don't know this data yet and hence, the results for this microarchitecture may not be optimal (hope this can be improved in the future, when I can have the opportunity to run tests on such microarchitecture).

_NOTE:_ "Slots" column is calculated by means of `FPUs x Latency`.
